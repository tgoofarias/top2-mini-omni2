The Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 was a tense 13-day confrontation between the United States 
and the Soviet Union over the placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The conflict began when the 
Soviet Union threatened to launch a nuclear test on the United States' missiles in Havana, Cuba. 
The crisis lasted for 13 days, and the United States and the Soviet Union were forced to withdraw 
their missiles from Cuba. The conflict was eventually resolved through negotiations between the 
two superpowers, but the crisis had a lasting impact on the relationship between the two countries.
